<!-- ## HTML 101

## html:5 and then clicking it will pop the following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en"> // this is similar to a key value pair. Html is a tag
    <head> // user will not see this
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> //charset means character set. there is no closing tag for meta, because it doesn't have content. you can add /> though like <meta charset="UTF-8"/> just so it's easier to scan
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> //compatibility rending of internet explorer
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> //this is responsive design, which will indicate if it's through pc, mobile, etc
        <title>Document</title> //user will see this, this is what shows on the browser
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
## Above, html, head, mete, title, body, are all called "tags".
## There are different kind of tags. html, for example has a beginning and end tag. if it has a '/' it is an ending tag.  -->
