## `async`/`await` handles asynchronous data with a syntax that is fairly easy to read

### Terms
**`async`**
A keyword we use to prefix functions that handle asynchronous data.

**`await`**
A keyword we use to prefix the name of the function which calls async code and in which the response is cached. This keyword must be used inside of another function that is prefixed with `async`.

**`.catch`**
A method chained to the response object to which we supply a callback function to handle errors.
