# API 303
## There are many different types of HTTP requests but you will mainly deal with just five of them.

### Common HTTP request
** `DELETE` **
to delete data

** `GET` **
to retrieve data

** `PATCH` **
to update data by overwriting only a part of a larger data set
<!-- difference between PUT is: it would only replace an email address, doesn't have to replace any other data -->

** `POST` **
to create new data

** `PUT` **
to put data by overwriting everything in the data set
<!-- difference between PATCH is: think of email, if you replace it, you'd have to type the data again, the name, the address, phone number etc -->

NOTE: * `PATCH` * and * `PUT` * are similar but our practices will concentrate on * `PUT` *
