# API 302
## We use HTTP verbs to describe API requests and nouns to refer to the data they handle.

### HTTP Verbs
There are four verbs. Together, we sometimes refer to what they do as *CRUD* operations
- create
- read
- update
- delete

### Nouns
These describe the data and are usually preceded by a `/`. Example below.
- `/contacts`
- `/users`
- `/photos`
- `/countries`
